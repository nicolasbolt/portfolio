            <p>I am a software developer with professional experience working with Javascript and PHP.  Outside of that experience I have knowledge using Python, Java, and C.  Using those languages I also have experience using React, NextJs, Express and Django.  Before working as a developer I have experience working in IT support at Noblesville Schools.  My other experience includes working as a freelancer to engineer solutions to various problems, most of which included using Python and Django to accomplish this.</p>
